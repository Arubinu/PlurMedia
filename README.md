# PlurMedia

With this program in **Node.JS**, you can list your *media* *(Movies, Series, Manga, comics, etc ...)* in a *Web Interface*. The advantage is that it is *Portable*, so you can easily carry it on your storage devices!

This project is in progress and is not complete. It is still possible to try it by following the steps below.

### Initialization
It is necessary to install modules before you can launch the application.

> npm install

### Utilisation
Launch the application in console mode:
> npm start

Find now the *Web Interface* at the following address: http://localhost:8842

Launch the application in graphical mode *(add an icon in the system tray)*:
> npm run dev

### Compilation
As mentioned above, it is possible to compact this application:
> npm run build

### Notes
For the moment, it is essential to modify the resources, as well as the **Database Stored** in the file `default.db` *(SQLite)*, in order to enrich its library.

Thank you for your interest in the project.
And do not hesitate to participate in its development.
